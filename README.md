## Original Requset
### R1
Deeper insight into the nature and degree of inhomogeneities could be obtained by integrating experimental observations similar to those presented in Fig. 1(a, b). Such
an analysis would help establish the ground for the comparison of experiments and simulations. Furthermore, since
our theoretical study is constrained to a smaller system
size (13.8nm × 13.8nm ≫ 50 × 50lattice points) compared
to the experimental sample (270nm × 270nm), it will help
to show spatially resolved experimental data over a region
comparable to our simulation, if possible.
### R2
For a favorable comparison between our findings and
experiential observations, it would be beneficial to establish experimental validation of the spatial correlations between ∆i and the distributions of coherence peak heights
(hi). Whether similar correlations or anticorrelations between the two emerge in actual data would strengthen
our claim. Further, a favorable comparison (if at all!) of
theoretical and experimental results of P(∆i), P(hi), and
P(N(i, Eg/2)will strengthen our claims.

### R3
Experimental input is needed in Fig. 4, identifying
Abrikosov and Josephson Vortices. Even if the experimental characterization of these two groups of vortices is not
identical, they are still of value as long as there is a consistency between theory and experiment.
